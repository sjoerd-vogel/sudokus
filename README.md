# About sudokus
This is an attempt at writing a sudoku generator. It is currently a work in progress. For now this project uses gradle without gradle wrapper (I refuse to commit binaries because of a design decision made by a build-tool). This project is currently very volatile and may break at any moment, please dont use as a dependency.

build project using `gradle build` with a sufficiently recent version of gradle and java version 18

I will try to not force push to master. No promises. Prefer git fetch/reset workflows over pulls.
