# About sudokus
This is an attempt at writing a sudoku generator. It is currently a work in progress. For now this project uses apache maven, this will probably change to gradle at some point. This project is currently very volatile and may break at any moment, please dont use as a dependency.

This project attempts to use kotlin in a functional manner and tries to stay as flexible as posible, to allow for future extensions to less common variations on sudokus (eg defferently shaped boards).

I will try to not force push to master. No promises. Prefer git fetch/reset workflows over pulls.
